							<h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Smart Traffic Management
									<p class="pro">Develop an intelligent traffic management system that uses IoT devices to collect data and optimize traffic flow. The system should be able to analyze traffic patterns and make real-time decisions to minimize congestion, reduce travel time, and improve safety.</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System
								<p class="pro">Develop a system to monitor indoor air quality in public spaces using IoT devices. The system should be able to detect pollutants, measure air quality, and provide real-time alerts to building management and occupants.

								</li>
								<li>
									Smart Navigation
									<p class="pro">
										Develop an IoT-based system that can provide real-time navigation guidance for the visually impaired, such as through audio feedback or haptic sensors, and provide route optimization and obstacle avoidance capabilities.
									</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									A system of IoT devices to measure load weight in a dumper.
									<p class="pro">
										The object is to provide a solution to measure the load weight of the dumper using IoT technology. The solution should give dynamic measurements based of coal loaded into the dumper which will help stop overloading of the dumper and hence mitigate the risks of fatal accidents.

									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Software Tool to aid Search and Rescue of an aircraft
									<p class="pro">
										If contact with an aircraft is lost, it leads to the death of everyone in it, but in such rare cases, if we can find the expected location of the crash accurately, there can be chances of rescuing people.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Creating a platform for a community-driven recycling initiative
									<p class="pro">
										 User registration and authentication, location-based recycling centers, item categorization, gamification elements, rewards system, tracking and reporting recycling efforts, social sharing, CMS for educational resources.
									</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									Low-cost, high-level tracking system for packages
									<p class="pro">
 									Nowadays, it's all about online shopping, and people worry about their package status. So design a tracking system that provides real-time information about your package and possible time for delivery.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									 Self-driving vehicle algorithm and code using ML/AI computer vision
									<p class="pro">
										One of the most remarkable applications of Machine Learning today is the self-driving or autonomous car. Design a Machine Learning based self-driving vehicle that will improve and enhance autonomous cars' functions and performance.

									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Smart Inventory System.
									</li>
										
								<li>
									Development of App for Plant  Disease Detection.
								</li>
								<li>
									Animal recognition in forest region highways to alert passersby using machine learning or deep learning techniques.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									Improve night accuracy in object detection and tracking.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									Real time student behaviour monitoring in classroom.
								</li>
