							<h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Smart Traffic Management
									<p class="pro">Develop an intelligent traffic management system that uses IoT devices to collect data and optimize traffic flow. The system should be able to analyze traffic patterns and make real-time decisions to minimize congestion, reduce travel time, and improve safety.</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System
								<p class="pro">Develop a system to monitor indoor air quality in public spaces using IoT devices. The system should be able to detect pollutants, measure air quality, and provide real-time alerts to building management and occupants.

								</li>
								<li>
									Smart Navigation
									<p class="pro">
										Develop an IoT-based system that can provide real-time navigation guidance for the visually impaired, such as through audio feedback or haptic sensors, and provide route optimization and obstacle avoidance capabilities.
									</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									A system of IoT devices to measure load weight in a dumper.
									<p class="pro">
										The object is to provide a solution to measure the load weight of the dumper using IoT technology. The solution should give dynamic measurements based of coal loaded into the dumper which will help stop overloading of the dumper and hence mitigate the risks of fatal accidents.

									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Software Tool to aid Search and Rescue of an aircraft
									<p class="pro">
										If contact with an aircraft is lost, it leads to the death of everyone in it, but in such rare cases, if we can find the expected location of the crash accurately, there can be chances of rescuing people.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Creating a platform for a community-driven recycling initiative
									<p class="pro">
										 User registration and authentication, location-based recycling centers, item categorization, gamification elements, rewards system, tracking and reporting recycling efforts, social sharing, CMS for educational resources.
									</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									Low-cost, high-level tracking system for packages
									<p class="pro">
 									Nowadays, it's all about online shopping, and people worry about their package status. So design a tracking system that provides real-time information about your package and possible time for delivery.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									 Self-driving vehicle algorithm and code using ML/AI computer vision
									<p class="pro">
										One of the most remarkable applications of Machine Learning today is the self-driving or autonomous car. Design a Machine Learning based self-driving vehicle that will improve and enhance autonomous cars' functions and performance.

									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="np">
									Develop an algorithm to identify fake news articles. This algorithm could be used to help people identify and avoid fake news, which can have a negative impact on society.
								</li>
								<li class="np">
									Create a tool to help people with disabilities access information and services online. This tool could make it easier for people with disabilities to participate in society and live independently.
								</li>
								<li class="np">
									Develop a system for health insurance providers using health data available via smartwatches to calculate custom premium payment plans. (Hardware/software).
								</li>
								<li class="np">
									Develop an AI-powered tool that will make it easier for people to access legal information. The tool should be able to answer questions about the law, find relevant legal documents, and provide legal advice.
								</li>
								<li class="np">
									Develop an AI-powered tool that will help to reduce traffic congestion. The tool should be able to predict traffic patterns, adjust traffic signals, and provide real-time information to drivers.
								</li>
								<li class="np">
									Develop an AI-powered tool that will help maintain personal vehicles better. The tool should be able to analyze the current driving pattern and suggest changes for fuel efficiency and vehicle performance & maintenance. (Hardware)
								</li>
								<li class="np">
									Develop an algorithm that will help make social media recommendations more personalized and diverse (non-repetitive content). The tool should be able to track user engagement, recommend content that is likely to be of interest, provide real-time feedback to users, and discover new buckets of interests.
								</li>
								<li class="np">
									Smart Inventory System.
									</li>
										
								<li class="np">
									Development of App for Plant  Disease Detection.
								</li>
								<li class="np">
									Animal recognition in forest region highways to alert passersby using machine learning or deep learning techniques.
								</li>
								
								<li class="np">
									Improve night accuracy in object detection and tracking.
								</li>
								
								<li class="np">
									Real time student behaviour monitoring in classroom.
								</li>
